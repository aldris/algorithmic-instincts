# Ch0 — DFS / Recursion

Foundation: learn *how* to think, then *what* to think. Tree / Graph / DP / Backtracking all build on this.

## When to think recursion / DFS

- Same structure, smaller subproblem
- Explore all choices / paths
- (Signals to fill)

## Recursion contract

- Base case
- Recurrence
- (Template / failure modes to fill)

## State ownership

- Who owns the state; what gets passed vs global
- (To fill)

## DFS vs BFS — when which

- DFS: path, explore all, stack-friendly
- BFS: level, shortest (unweighted), queue
- (To fill)

## Divide and conquer (分治)

- Split → recurse on subproblems → combine
- When: subproblems independent; combine cost acceptable
- Merge sort, quick sort as examples; (template to fill)

## Failure modes

- (To fill)
