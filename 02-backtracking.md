# Ch2 — Backtracking

Control the exponential. Backtracking = DFS + explicit state management. Tree is implicit state; here we roll back.

- "All combinations", "all paths", "all solutions"
- Choices at each step; need to undo

## Decision tree

- Branch = choice; leaf = solution or dead end

## Prune

- When to skip a branch (invalid, dominated)
- (To fill)

## State rollback

- Push choice → recurse → pop (undo)
- (Template to fill)

## Failure modes
