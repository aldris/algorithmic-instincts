# Ch3 — Binary Search & Two Pointers

Where interviews fail on details. Non-recursive; strong invariants and boundaries.

## Sorting (排序)

- Foundation for binary search on array/list; "sort the array"; need order
- Quick sort partition (template); merge sort (分治); when counting sort / heap sort
- (To fill)

## When to think binary search

- Sorted (or sortable); "find/smallest/largest"; O(log n) hint
- Search on index or on answer space
- (Signals to fill)

## Search invariant

- What is true for left half / right half; loop condition; mid bias
- (Template to fill)

## Search answer space

- Binary search on value; check(mid) feasible?
- (To fill)

## Two pointers / sliding window

- Same direction: window, subarray
- Opposite: pair sum, in-place
- (Template to fill)

## Linked list

- When: reverse, merge, cycle detection, dummy node
- Fast/slow pointers; prev/curr; (template to fill)

## Prefix sum + hash

- When: "subarray sum = K", "two indices such that ..."
- prefix_sum → count or index; (template to fill)

## Failure modes

- Off-by-one; inclusive vs exclusive; empty input
- (To fill)
