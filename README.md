# algorithmic-instincts

Train algorithmic instincts for Meta/Google interviews—recognition and decision-making, not documentation. Handwritable notes: signals, templates, failure modes.

## Chapters

- [Ch0 — DFS / Recursion](00-dfs-recursion.md) — Foundation: how to think, then what to think
- [Ch1 — Tree](01-tree.md) — Highest ROI; subtree return, merge, path/validity
- [Ch2 — Backtracking](02-backtracking.md) — Exponential control; decision tree, prune, rollback
- [Ch3 — Binary Search & Two Pointers](03-binary-search-two-pointers.md) — Invariants, boundaries, window
- [Ch4 — Data Structures](04-data-structures.md) — Choice not implementation; heap, monotonic stack, trie
- [Ch5 — Graph](05-graph.md) — Tree + visited + cycles; components, BFS shortest
- [Ch6 — Dynamic Programming](06-dp.md) — Recursion + memo; state, top-down, 1D/2D/tree
- [Ch7 — Greedy](07-greedy.md) — Proof ability; sort strategy, safety, counterexample
- [Ch8 — Misc](08-misc.md) — Bit / math; XOR, bits, power of 2

Structure may evolve; we can refine as we go.
