# Chat preferences

1. For this project, answer in Chinese. For noun/terminology, add the English term in parentheses (e.g. 递归 (recursion), DFS, BFS).
2. Be concise; avoid unnecessary elaboration.
3. Do not modify any file without my explicit approval first.

# Project principles (algorithmic-instincts)

- Train algorithmic instincts, not document algorithms.
- Optimize for recognition and decision-making, not explanation.
- Prefer templates, signals, and failure modes over full solutions.
- Every section must answer: "When should I think of this approach?"
- If content is hard to handwrite, it is too verbose.
- Remove anything that does not improve interview performance.
- **Write chapter content in Chinese.** User thinks in Chinese; Chinese docs improve recall. For noun/terminology, add the English term (e.g. 递归 (recursion)). Code and variable names stay in English.
