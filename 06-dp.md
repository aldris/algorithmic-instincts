# Ch6 — Dynamic Programming

Good DP = recursion + memo. Not a new algorithm—optimized recursion. Recursion shaky ⇒ DP wrong.

## When to think DP

- Optimal (min/max) or count ways; overlapping subproblems
- (Signals to fill)

## State definition

- What does dp[i] or dp[i][j] mean?
- (To fill)

## Top-down first

- Recursion + memo; then convert to table if needed
- (Template to fill)

## Bottom-up (递推)

- Fill table in dependency order; loop from base case upward
- When: avoid stack overflow; need O(1) or rolling space; iteration order is clear
- (Template to fill)

## 1D / 2D / Tree DP

- 1D: linear array, one sequence
- 2D: two sequences, interval
- Tree: subtree → node
- (To fill)

## Failure modes

- (To fill)
